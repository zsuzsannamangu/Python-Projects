# Python Projects

This repository showcases a collection of projects developed using Python and the Django framework.

## [Webpage Generator Project](https://github.com/zsuzsannamangu/Python-Projects/tree/master/Python-Projects/WebPage_Generator)
This program can automatically create a basic HTML web page and display the text that the user inputted into the text field.
I used Python and Tkinter for this project.

## [File Transfer Project](https://github.com/zsuzsannamangu/Python-Projects/tree/master/Python-Projects/File_Transfer_Assignment)
With this program, you can move files from one folder to another with the click of a button. I used Python and Tkinter for this project.

## [Checkbook Project](https://github.com/zsuzsannamangu/Python-Projects/tree/master/Python-Projects/Checkbook_Project)
This is an application for keeping track of various bank accounts. The user can create an account, add a transaction (withdrawal or deposit), see their bank account balance and all transactions that apply to it. I used Python and Django to create this application.
