# Python Projects

This repository showcases a collection of projects developed using Python, the Django framework and Tkinter. Additionally, it contains Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning projects using Python.

## [Webpage Generator Project](https://github.com/zsuzsannamangu/Python-Projects/tree/master/Python-Projects/WebPage_Generator)
This program can automatically create a basic HTML web page and display the text that the user inputted into the text field.
I used Python and Tkinter for this project.

## [File Transfer Project](https://github.com/zsuzsannamangu/Python-Projects/tree/master/Python-Projects/File_Transfer_Assignment)
With this program, you can move files from one folder to another with the click of a button. I used Python and Tkinter for this project.

## [Checkbook Project](https://github.com/zsuzsannamangu/Python-Projects/tree/master/Python-Projects/Checkbook_Project)
This is an application for keeping track of various bank accounts. The user can create an account, add a transaction (withdrawal or deposit), see their bank account balance and all transactions that apply to it. I used Python and Django to create this application.

## [Timeseries Prediction Project](https://github.com/zsuzsannamangu/Python-Projects/tree/master/Python-Projects/AI-Projects/Timeseries_Prediction)
This application predicts and visualizes daily temperatures using time series prediction, which involves forecasting future values based on historical data 
patterns by identifying trends, reoccurance, regularity, and other patterns. I used Python and the following libraries: for data manipulation: pandas, for forecasting: Prophet, and for data visualization: matplotlib and plotly.

## [Sentiment Analysis Project](https://github.com/zsuzsannamangu/Python-Projects/tree/master/Python-Projects/Sentiment_Analysis)
Sentiment Analysis is a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves determining the emotional tone behind a body of text. This application analyzes text data to extract subjective information and classifies text as positive or negative. I used Python and the following libraries: for data manipulation: pandas, for text processing: re, to build and evaluate a machine learning model: Scikit-Learn, to preprocess text data: NLTK, and for GUI: Flask.
